<h2>Pretext &amp; Arrival</h2>
      <p>It&#39;s hard for me to know where to begin writing about my time in China. Perhaps we start with how I arrived at Arrivals in Nanjing Hukou International Airport.</p>
      <p>The end of high school and all of college were more or less a mess for me. I was a fairly competitive runner - extremely talented but nagged by injury and illness - and had envisioned going to college on some kind of running scholarship. My senior year, that was derailed by a mysterious illness that no doctor nor all of modern science could diagnose much less treat. The illness lasted months and seemed to affect my body&#39;s ability to produce mitochondria, or energy. When I ran, I was often in the lactic threshold within a minute or two, which makes competing at the highest level more or less impossible. In the Sectional race, I &quot;bonked&quot; really hard and was hospitalized. Still I qualified for the State meet, but dropped out when I felt another bonk coming on - the doctors had warned me that stressing my system that hard again could be deadly. So no scholarship from cross country, then I overtrained and profoundly injured myself for track. </p>
      <p>While this was all happening, I broke up with my girlfriend of three years due to the emotional trauma of having my life plan derailed; was rejected from every college I actually wanted to attend - in spite of receiving full ROTC scholarships to multiple, including UC Berkeley; and another Christmas came and went living in a relatively poor family in one of the most affluent suburbs in Chicagoland.</p>
      <p>I eventually matriculated and commuted to DePaul University but was underwhelmed academically, and moreover was told that I would need to try out to walk on to the team, and being injured I wasn&#39;t able to run the necessary times to make the track or cross country teams. I decided to transfer to Grinnell College - a school that my mother, who I had blowout arguments with over how to pay for college, had campaigned extremely hard for because of their merit-based scholarships. I received a scholarship and a year after graduating high school, left suburban Illinois for rural Iowa.</p>
      <p>My time in Grinnell was transformative, but not in a &quot;happy path&quot; way. I found that people there had been raised in what seemed to be entirely different environments than my own - everyone was extremely sensitive and perhaps overly empathetic, whereas I was insensitive and lacking in empathy. The social learning curve there was extremely difficult; my running career was once again derailed by injury; the aforementioned long-term girlfriend I had dumped (we eventually got back together) dumped me; my grandma was diagnosed with and within a few months died of cancer. Basically, I was unmoored from many if not most everything that I had based my identity on growing up: the personality that had been successful in Chicago was rejected in Grinnell; the relationships that had stabilized turmoil in high school were both geographically and emotionally removed; my running career had once again betrayed me; and so on.</p>
      <p>Long story short, I learned a lot in Grinnell, but most of it was about how to navigate negativity and uncomfortable-if-not-hostile social environments.</p>
      <p>Fast-forward to graduation and I had interned with Credit Suisse&#39;s sub-prime asset investment banking division (this was summer 2008, mind you) but between the market crash and getting drunk and affectionately calling one of my Directors a &quot;pussy&quot; while broing out with the boys, a job offer never came. Given my commitment to running, I had never studied abroad in college and really felt that itch. Shortly after graduating mid-year, in December 2008, <a href="http://drakeballew.com/photos/panama-city-san-blas">I went to Panama for a couple weeks</a>. That was a shitshow but the experience got me hooked on traveling, and I decided to teach English as a means of getting and living abroad (I had previously applied for Teach For America and was rejected; I knew that teaching was something I wanted to try at some point). I was accepted by a number of programs and couldn&#39;t decide between an opportunity in the remote jungles of Guyana or an urban opportunity in Nanjing, China. I put the decision to a Facebook poll and the overwhelming majority (90%+) said China.</p>
      <p>So that&#39;s how I arrived at Arrivals in Nanjing Hukou International Airport.</p>
      <p>Perhaps if I were writing this at a different time - earlier and more ignorant, or later with more time for memory to fade and my mind to heal - I would reflect on my time in China differently, but as it is today, 12 years or so since leaving, my time in China served two important purposes: one, to show me how big the world is, and how similar we all are in spite of our different languages, cultures, geographies, and so on; two, to give me distance from my previous experiences and relationships in America and allow me to see them more objectively.</p>
      <p>In any case, upon arriving in Arrivals, I quickly discovered that the person who was supposed to pick me up was not there. Luckily, a young Chinese student who was studying in America spotted me and spoke enough English to understand that I was in need of assistance. She asked her family, and they gave me a ride to Nanjing Foreign Language School (hitchhiking conversation: &quot;You&#39;re a teacher at NanWai? That&#39;s a <strong>good</strong> school&quot;), where I would be a foreign teacher for some extremely gifted and some 6th and 7th grade students from extremely well-connected families.</p>
      <h2>Learning to Teach &amp; Learning to Learn</h2>
      <p>And sure enough, the good samaritans who gave me a lift were right - NanWai (or NFLS, the corresponding English abbreviation) <em>was</em> a good school, and the students were outstanding - energetic, curious, thoughtful, playful - it was a joy to get to know my students, and in many ways learn about and remember who I was when I was at their age (what 12 year old has self awareness? Not I) from observing them.</p>
      <p>But I quickly found out that teaching at NanWai was not what I had imagined it would be. Technically we weren&#39;t teachers, we were &quot;Foreign Experts&quot; and that is probably more true-to-form in terms of what my job description was: I was largely there to help students, many of whom aspired to and eventually did study abroad, gain confidence in their English speaking skills. </p>
      <p>Where I had envisioned that I would be teaching in an American classroom sense, what I was more tasked with doing was a fluidly dynamic mix of entertainment, engagement, and play. In practice, this looked like a lot of trying to remember (and Googling) verbal games from my own childhood, figuring out a way to adapt them to classroom dynamics, and often power flexing those I-Banking Intern PowerPoint skills to create games that would keep everyone engaged, mostly speaking English, and enjoying themselves.[^0]</p>
      <p>Unfortunately/fortunately, this level of difficulty at work freed up perhaps too much of the mental and emotional world for my 23 year old self, and this led to some nights that bled into mornings where I went straight from partying in the clurb to &quot;teaching&quot; English.[^1] The relative ease of work also freed up my imagination to what else was possible while I was abroad since we had been told how to find coordinate substitutes if we were sick or planned to be away, something that I took perhaps too much advantage of throughout my time abroad, as you will see.</p>
      <p>[^0]: The biggest hit, by far, was a PowerPoint version of Taboo that I pimped out to have a countdown timer and bomb animations, etc. Big big hit. Milked that one for years.</p>
      <p>[^1]: Drinking and marauding till dawn or near-dawn and then strolling into work was a bad habit that I never broke while I was in China, unfortunately.</p>
