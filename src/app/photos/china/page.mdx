<p>It&#39;s hard for me to know where to begin writing about my time in China. Perhaps we start with how I arrived at Arrivals in Nanjing Hukou International Airport.</p>
      <p>The end of high school and all of college were more or less a mess for me. I was a fairly competitive runner - extremely talented but nagged by injury and illness - and had envisioned going to college on some kind of running scholarship. My senior year, that was derailed by a mysterious illness that no doctor nor all of modern science could diagnose much less treat. The illness lasted months and seemed to affect my body&#39;s ability to produce mitochondria, or energy. When I ran, I was often in the lactic threshold within a minute or two, which makes competing at the highest level more or less impossible. In the Sectional race, I &quot;bonked&quot; really hard and was hospitalized. Still I qualified for the State meet, but dropped out when I felt another bonk coming on - the doctors had warned me that stressing my system that hard again could be deadly. So no scholarship from cross country, then I overtrained and profoundly injured myself for track. </p>
      <p>While this was all happening, I broke up with my girlfriend of three years due to the emotional trauma of having my life plan derailed; was rejected from every college I actually wanted to attend - in spite of receiving full ROTC scholarships to multiple, including UC Berkeley; and another Christmas came and went living in a relatively poor family in one of the most affluent suburbs in Chicagoland.</p>
      <p>I eventually matriculated and commuted to DePaul University but was underwhelmed academically, and moreover was told that I would need to try out to walk on to the team, and being injured I wasn&#39;t able to run the necessary times to make the track or cross country teams. I decided to transfer to Grinnell College - a school that my mother, who I had blowout arguments with over how to pay for college, had campaigned extremely hard for because of their merit-based scholarships. I received a scholarship and a year after graduating high school, left suburban Illinois for rural Iowa.</p>
      <p>My time in Grinnell was transformative, but not in a &quot;happy path&quot; way. I found that people there had been raised in what seemed to be entirely different environments than my own - everyone was extremely sensitive and perhaps overly empathetic, whereas I was insensitive and lacking in empathy. The social learning curve there was extremely difficult; my running career was once again derailed by injury; the aforementioned long-term girlfriend I had dumped (we eventually got back together) dumped me; my grandma was diagnosed with and within a few months died of cancer. Basically, I was unmoored from many if not most everything that I had based my identity on growing up: the personality that had been successful in Chicago was rejected in Grinnell; the relationships that had stabilized turmoil in high school were both geographically and emotionally removed; my running career had once again betrayed me; and so on.</p>
      <p>Long story short, I learned a lot in Grinnell, but most of it was about how to navigate negative social environments.</p>
      <p>Fast-forward to graduation and I had interned with Credit Suisse&#39;s sub-prime asset investment banking division (this was summer 2008, mind you) but between the market crash and getting drunk and affectionately calling one of my Directors a &quot;pussy&quot; while broing out with the boys, a job offer never came. Given my commitment to running, I had never studied abroad in college and really felt that itch. Shortly after graduating mid-year, in December 2008, I went to Panama for a couple weeks. That was a shitshow but the experience got me hooked on traveling, and I decided to teach English as a means of getting and living abroad (I had previously applied for Teach For America and was rejected; I knew that teaching was something I wanted to try at some point). I was accepted by a number of programs and couldn&#39;t decide between an opportunity in the remote jungles of Guyana or an urban opportunity in Nanjing, China. I put the decision to a Facebook poll and the overwhelming majority (90%+) said China.</p>
      <p>So that&#39;s how I arrived at Arrivals in Nanjing Hukou International Airport.</p>
      <p>Perhaps if I were writing this at a different time - earlier and more ignorant, or later with more time for memory to fade and my mind to heal - I would reflect on my time in China differently, but as it is today, 12 years or so since leaving, my time in China served two important purposes: one, to show me how big the world is, and how similar we all are in spite of our different languages, cultures, geographies, and so on; two, to give me distance from my previous experiences and relationships in America and allow me to see them more objectively.</p>
      <p>In any case, upon arriving in Arrivals, I quickly discovered that the person who was supposed to pick me up was not there. Luckily, a young Chinese student who was studying in America spotted me and spoke enough English to understand that I was in need of assistance. She asked her family, and they gave me a ride to Nanjing Foreign Language School (hitchhiking conversation: &quot;You&#39;re a teacher at NanWai? That&#39;s a <strong>good</strong> school&quot;), where I would be a foreign teacher for some extremely gifted and some 6th and 7th grade students from extremely well-connected families.</p>
