While I’m on my soapbox today, I’ll take a second and talk about White Guilt and how it is just another form of racism.

First, let’s talk about racism, which is just a subset of discrimination, which is the differential treatment of someone or a group of people based on some arbitrary variable: skin color, sexual orientation, curly vs straight hair, Nickelback fans, whatever. Racism is discrimination based on race, and race in America is closely tied to the color of your skin bc we’re too stupid to define it in any more subtle or detailed way.

White Guilt is a phenomenon amongst White Liberals (capitals used intentionally, mind you) where their moral conscience pains for another group, and so they go out of their way as a member of the oppressor group to perform like an Ally to whatever marginalized group is out there.

Don’t get me wrong, this is better than overtly or subtly violent racism, but it’s still racism.

Why? Because White Guilt still relies on the discriminatory principle that you are White and the Other is not. No amount of emotional turmoil, performative behavior, monetary sacrifice, or whatever else will change this. Racism is racism, whether it’s good or bad for the marginalized party.

If you want to escape White Guilt, you need to become white. You can feel guilt as a white person, but this guilt does not make you inherently racist, whereas so long as you feel White Guilt, I hate to break it to ya, but you’re fuckin racist.
