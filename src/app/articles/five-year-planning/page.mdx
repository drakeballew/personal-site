<p>Quick one:</p>
      <p>I see a lot of posts on social and otherwise that are like &quot;just pinch your buttcheeks and wish hard and your dreams when you were a kid will manifest.&quot;</p>
      <p>Obviously problematic for a lot of reasons, but the bone I want to pick is with the least obviously controversial part of the whole equation.</p>
      <p>What I want to contest is whether you should have the same dreams as you did when you were a kid. If you do, that either suggests a remarkable clarity of morals and values that you&#39;ve seen through to adulthood and continue to agree and adhere to, or socio-/psycho-pathy.</p>
      <p>What these posts are trying to get at is some kind of childlike feeling of fulfillment/&quot;I made it.&quot; But what they are doing is dishonest: they say shit like &quot;everything you wanted when you were a kid&quot; rather than what it really means, which is almost <em>always</em> related to money, power, and influence.</p>
      <p>It&#39;s fine if you are an adult and are primarily concerned about money, power, and influence - that is the world we live in and has always been that way. </p>
      <p>My problem is with naming that as your childhood aspiration. I don&#39;t believe that. Children have much loftier and higher aspirations, generally, than money and power. If you were a sociopath as a child, fine. But otherwise, think it through and find better words.</p>
