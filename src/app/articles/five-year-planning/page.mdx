Quick one:

I see a lot of posts on social and otherwise that are like "just pinch your buttcheeks and wish hard and your dreams when you were a kid will manifest."

Obviously problematic for a lot of reasons, but the bone I want to pick is with the least obviously controversial part of the whole equation.

What I want to contest is whether you should have the same dreams as you did when you were a kid. If you do, that either suggests a remarkable clarity of morals and values that you've seen through to adulthood and continue to agree and adhere to, or socio-/psycho-pathy.

What these posts are trying to get at is some kind of childlike feeling of fulfillment/"I made it." But what they are doing is dishonest: they say shit like "everything you wanted when you were a kid" rather than what it really means, which is almost *always* related to money, power, and influence.

It's fine if you are an adult and are primarily concerned about money, power, and influence - that is the world we live in and has always been that way. 

My problem is with naming that as your childhood aspiration. I don't believe that. Children have much loftier and higher aspirations, generally, than money and power. If you were a sociopath as a child, fine. But otherwise, think it through and find better words.
