Another short one. As I said yesterday, I will no longer be tolerating relationships where I am mistreated, and as such, I am no longer recommending [https://pipedream.com/][Pipedream] as a software product.

For context, I know one of Pipedream's founders from college and have long been a supporter and advocate in part because the product is differentiated in a crowded space and in part because I like to see people I know succeed.

Fast forward, and over the last 2-3 years, I have had tremendous amounts of trouble with Pipedream's product and team. The product would just magically break, the team would try to upsell me rather than address my questions directly: "If you just upgrade your account (which I had literally upgraded the day prior) to the next plan up, we can look at this issue that caused you to upgrade your account in the first place for you." Product issues are one thing. People issues are another.

Since January or December, I have been a Pipedream affiliate, which basically means that Pipedream and I have entered into an agreement where I get some percentage of revenue that I refer to their company. To say that my experience as an affiliate has been poor is an understatement.

I directly signed up two clients myself - as in I literally created the accounts myself - and in spite of being in direct contact with CEO [Tod Saceroti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sacerdoti/) himself issue, my affiliate account has not been correctly credited for the revenue I generated for them. As of this morning, it has been going on six weeks and the team there has not addressed the issues. My first email with the complaint occurred on March 29. On May 1, Tod told me the issue was fixed, but he or whoever fixed it did not credit me for the correct revenue amount. So it took me 32 days to get them to do a bang up job, and now it's been nearly another week, and despite having sent seven follow up emails over the last six days, I have not gotten a response.

The reality here is that Tod, and likely many members of his team, are treating me like an asshole. And like I wrote yesterday, I'm done working with assholes. As such, I no longer recommend Pipedream as a product and will no longer be assisting them with their affiliate marketing.

If you're looking for alternative services, here are some alternatives in the space, ordered from least to most complex: [https://zapier.com/](Zapier), [https://make.com/](Make), [https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/](AWS Lambda).

I encourage anyone who gets treated like a second class citizen like I have been by Tod and the team at Pipedream to take their business elsewhere, and will no longer be recommending their product.
