Hopefully this will be a short post.[^0]  
The idea I want to discuss is **progress**—specifically humanity’s progress as a species, and, even more narrowly, society’s progress since we coalesced into a *global* civilization, far removed from our earlier nomadic–tribal roots.

If you boil “progress” down to its fundamentals, the **input** is *thought* and the **output** is some material thing—medicine, art, a laser beam, whatever.

We are living in an unprecedented age for many reasons, but perhaps the most important distinction of our era is that *thought* is no longer restricted to human brains. Even as recently as 75 years ago this was still true; today we routinely allow computers to **decide** for us, and are beginning to let them **create** for us. The results have been staggering. In almost every field, the cumulative progress of the last three-quarters of a century borders on the unbelievable—and we are surely only at the beginning of what it means to off-load thinking to machines that, properly trained and calibrated, can recognize patterns with an efficiency humans will never match.[^1]

The **problem** is that political and economic thought has not advanced remotely as fast. That lag should produce a kind of mental whiplash for most readers.

### Mass displacement of human thought

To paraphrase the rosy paragraph above a little less idealistically: we stand on the precipice of an age in which *human* thought is going to be massively displaced. Minds currently devoted to flipping burgers, running dockyard cranes, writing creative briefs, designing logos—you name it—will soon be *free* to explore other interests.

Yet without new political and economic arrangements, the cost of that freedom will be extreme: we will tumble into a **progress trap** characterized by yawning wealth gaps. That wealth will entrench itself politically, embedding a **Shareholder Class** into the bones of modern democratic-capitalist society. (We are already well on our way: only ~10 % of Americans own stock at all, so rule by shareholders would be an *oligarchy*—with its own internal pecking order.)

### Two unsatisfying camps

In the United States, the public conversation is essentially locked into two—and only two—frames:

1. **Market-based theorists**  
   Claim that the displacement of labor will be solved by markets: new jobs will appear, people will learn the new skills, and everything will equilibrate.  
   *Fundamental flaw:* humans will never learn new skills as fast as machines will learn to do the *next* job.

2. **Communist-ish theorists**  
   Claim that displacement can only be solved by communal ownership of the means of technological production (in this context: the ML infrastructure & algorithms).  
   *Fundamental flaw:* absent coercion that shades into Stalinism, the highly valuable labor that creates the technology will simply leave for a market that values it more.

A balance must be struck between these extremes. I don’t know the final policy recipe, but ideologically the answer feels **socialist** in spirit, if not in name.[^2]

### Possible segments of a path *around* the trap

1. **Broad-based share ownership**  
   – e.g. updated collective-bargaining agreements that include meaningful equity for labor.  
2. **Universal basic income & universal healthcare**  
   – raise the floor, slash the cost of the priciest *necessity* (health).  
3. **New modalities for independent labor**  
   – platforms that provide *protections*, built-in audiences, and fair creative exchange.  
4. **Re-imagined education**  
   – the classroom may stay, but curricula must flex. Let students pursue interests; set *standards* for graduation, not one linear path to get there.  
5. **Fresh regulatory schemas for high-impact sectors**  
   – euphemistically: “OpenAI & friends.” Self-regulation has worked *so far*, but shouldn’t be the default forever.

I’m sure there are more; I’m too tired to keep writing. This is already longer and more complex than intended.

[^0]: Nope.

[^1]: For society, the looming reality is that many essential goods will require *vanishingly few* labor hours to produce. We should be able to drive the marginal cost of necessities to ~zero—an astonishing achievement for a species that, 175 years ago, suffered wave after wave of intercontinental migration driven by food insecurity.

[^2]: Ironically, if I had the resources, I would hire a team of economics PhDs to model tthis problem using the same advanced statistics that power the ML tools soon to displace human thought.
