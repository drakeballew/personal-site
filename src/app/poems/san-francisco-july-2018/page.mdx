They flew in on an inverted wind  
East to West  
like birds of the morning.

They came without warning,  
no call or discussion,  
and they came with intent.

For they were not songbirds  
meant to soothe or pollinate or sing:  
they were vultures  
arriving in search of flesh.

Mother, father, brother, sister,  
they flocked with false love,  
“love” their understanding of which was revealed  
as they insisted I was unmoored, dislodged,  
as they went about pulling my roots,  
ripping me out of the soil.

They were and remain birds   
attempting to be the wind itself,  
understanding themselves to be gods  
when in fact God has abandoned them.
