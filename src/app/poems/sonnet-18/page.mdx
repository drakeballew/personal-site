The light that falls across the floor at dawn
has not yet learned the weight of afternoon.
I watch it climb the wall and linger on
the edge of sleep, a half-remembered tune.

What stays when everything has moved along?
The room, the chair, the dust that settles down.
A draft comes through the window. Before long
the light has shifted. Shadows claim the ground.

So much depends on what we choose to keep—
the small refusals, what we let go by.
I trace the line from waking into sleep
and wonder what it means to say goodbye.

The light moves on. The room holds what it can.
I write this down. I do not understand.
